## Scope and Audience
- This policy applies to the LoloDex service available at lolodex.com and related interfaces that receive data via email, file uploads, and text messages.
- Service availability is global; however, data is hosted in the United States.

## Compliance Position (Important)
- We do not offer the service to individuals located in the EU/EEA or the UK. We implement gating measures (e.g., country selection and contractual representations) and may geoblock traffic/signups where feasible. If we learn that we have collected personal data from an EU/EEA/UK resident, we will delete it.
- We make no representation that the service complies with GDPR/UK GDPR/CCPA/CPRA or other regional privacy laws. Use at your own risk for compliance. For questions, contact alex@InvisibleBlock.com.

## Roles

- Vendor data‑use settings: We do not apply additional vendor‑side restrictions (e.g., toggling vendor training/retention flags) beyond the vendor’s defaults. Consult the vendor’s documentation for how they handle inputs/outputs. If you require stricter controls, contact us to discuss options.

## Your Rights and Requests
- You can request access, correction, deletion, export (data portability), restriction, objection, and opt‑out of certain processing or sharing (where applicable). If we ever sell/share personal information for cross‑context behavioral advertising, you may opt out; currently we do not engage in such practices.

- Export formats available: JSON, CSV, ZIP.

## International Transfers
- Data is stored and processed in the United States. If you access the service from other regions, your data may be transferred to and processed in the U.S.
