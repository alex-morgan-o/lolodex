# Terms of Service

Last updated: 2025-10-26

These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) govern your access to and use of the LoloDex service at lolodex.com and related interfaces (the “Service”). By using the Service, you agree to these Terms.

If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.

## 1. Who We Are
Invisible Block Inc. ("Company," "we," "us," "our")
- Address: 2945 Dundas St. W. #252D, Toronto, ON M6P 1Z2
- Contact: alex@InvisibleBlock.com

## 2. Eligibility and Geography
- You must be at least 16 years old to use the Service. If your jurisdiction requires a higher age (e.g., 18), you must meet that higher age requirement.
- EU/EEA/UK Exclusion: We do not offer the Service to residents of the EU/EEA or the UK. We implement gating (e.g., country selection and contractual representations) and may geoblock traffic/signups where feasible. If we learn that we have collected personal data from an EU/EEA/UK resident, we will delete it.

## 3. Accounts and Access
- You may create an account using email/password or SSO (Supabase authentication). You are responsible for safeguarding your credentials and for all activity under your account.
- You represent and warrant that you have the rights and permissions to connect any mailboxes, SMS numbers, files, and other sources you integrate, and that your use of the Service complies with applicable laws and third‑party terms.

## 4. Acceptable Use
You agree not to, and not to allow others to:
- Use the Service for unlawful activities, spam, malware distribution, credential harvesting, or to violate others’ rights.
- Upload or process high‑risk data such as protected health information (PHI), full payment card numbers, or government ID numbers, unless we explicitly agree in writing.
- Infringe intellectual property or other rights, or submit content you do not have the right to share.
- Attempt to probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of the Service without prior written consent; circumvent or attempt to defeat security or authentication measures.
- Interfere with or disrupt the Service, including excessive automated requests or scraping not permitted by robots.txt or our explicit consent.
- Reverse engineer the Service except as permitted by law.

## 5. Plans, Fees, and Billing
- Billing Model: Paid subscriptions are offered on monthly or annual terms and auto‑renew by default.
- Trials: New customers may receive a 14‑day trial. If you do not cancel before the trial ends, your subscription will begin and auto‑renew per the plan you selected.
- Cancellation: You may cancel at any time, effective at the end of the current billing period. We do not provide refunds or credits for partial periods, except where required by law.
- Currency and Taxes: Charges are in USD. Prices exclude taxes; we will collect applicable taxes where required, and you are responsible for any additional taxes or duties.
- Payment Failures: If payment is not received, we may suspend access after 30 days overdue. Continued non‑payment may result in termination.

## 6. Term, Suspension, and Termination
- Term: These Terms remain in effect until terminated.
- Suspension/Termination for Cause: We may suspend or terminate access immediately for violations of these Terms (including the Acceptable Use rules), non‑payment, security risks, suspected fraud, legal requests, or to prevent harm.
- Your Termination: You can cancel at any time via the Service or by contacting us; cancellation is effective at the end of the current billing period.
- Post‑Termination Data Handling: Upon termination, your account will be placed in read‑only mode for up to 30 days solely to allow export of Customer Data. Thereafter, Customer Data is scheduled for deletion, subject to backups that may persist for up to 30 days.

## 7. Data, Privacy, and Security
- Privacy: Our processing of personal data is described in our Privacy Policy (see privacy.md). We do not offer the Service to EU/EEA/UK residents and will delete such data upon discovery.
- Customer Data Ownership: As between you and us, you own your data and any outputs (“Customer Data” and “Output”).
- License to Provide the Service: You grant us a worldwide, non‑exclusive license to host, process, transmit, and display Customer Data and Output as necessary to provide and improve the Service.
- AI/Third‑Party Processing: We may use third‑party AI services (currently OpenAI’s API) to process Customer Data for extraction and summarization. Your use of AI‑powered features is also subject to the model vendor’s terms. Outputs may be inaccurate or incomplete; you must review before relying on them.
- Security: We implement reasonable safeguards, including encryption in transit and at rest, RBAC, MFA for internal access, audit logging, and vulnerability management. However, no method of transmission or storage is perfectly secure, and we do not warrant absolute security.

## 8. Service Providers (Subprocessors)
We use service providers to operate the Service, including Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Supabase, Postmark, Twilio, PostHog, Sentry, Stripe, and OpenAI. We share data with these providers solely to operate the Service under appropriate agreements. The list may change as we add or replace vendors.

## 9. Intellectual Property; Feedback; Publicity
- Service IP: We and our licensors retain all right, title, and interest in and to the Service, software, and related intellectual property.
- Feedback: If you provide feedback or suggestions, you grant us an irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, royalty‑free license to use that feedback for any purpose.
- Publicity: We may identify you as a customer (name and logo) on our website and in marketing materials, unless you opt out by notifying us.

## 12. Limitation of Liability
- TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUE, OR LOSS OF DATA, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
- OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICE WILL NOT EXCEED THE FEES PAID BY YOU TO US FOR THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. FOR FREE USERS, THE CAP IS USD $100.

## 13. Indemnification
You will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from or related to: (a) your Customer Data or Output; (b) your use or misuse of the Service; or (c) your violation of these Terms or applicable law.

## 14. Third‑Party Services
Certain features may depend on third‑party services (e.g., email, SMS, file storage, AI providers). We are not responsible for third‑party services, and your use of them is governed by their terms and policies.

## 15. Modifications to the Service
We may modify, suspend, or discontinue features of the Service at any time. If a change materially reduces core functionality for a paid plan, you may cancel and, where required by law, receive a pro‑rata refund for the unused portion of the billing period.

## 16. Changes to These Terms
We may update these Terms from time to time. For material changes, we will provide at least 30 days’ notice via the website, email, or in‑app notice. Your continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.

## 17. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
- Governing Law and Venue: These Terms are governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, without regard to conflict‑of‑laws rules. The courts located in Toronto, Ontario will have exclusive jurisdiction over disputes.
- Injunctive Relief: Nothing in this section prevents either party from seeking urgent or injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction.

You represent that you are not subject to sanctions or located in a prohibited jurisdiction and will not use the Service in violation of export, sanctions, or trade laws.

## 19. General

- Severability: If any provision is held unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in effect.
